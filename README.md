Low Latency Video Analytic Solution.

My name is Pankaj Thakur, and I am pursuing ME Computer Science & Engineering (Modular) from NITTTR Chandigarh under Panjab University. Under the guidance of my guide/superviser  Dr. K. G. Srinivasa, Professor at NITTTR, Chandigarh, we are working on a low latency video analytic solution on cloud.
Please read all the instructions given in Setup Instruction file carefully.

Extra instructions:
1.  The name of my PEM file is K30.pem. You have to create your own and store that in llvaslocal directory on locale machine (Laptop). 
2.  Also don't forget to replace the name K30.pem inside the llvaslocal.sh script file on local machine with your PEM file name.
