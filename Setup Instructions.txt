Step 1:	Setup one local and one remote machine as documented below:

	1.	Local machine (Laptop)
	------------------------------
	On the local Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop machine, create a directory llvaslocal in the user's home 		directory with following files and directory:
	1.	an empty directory attendance 
	2.	the PEM file to ssh EC2 instance
	3.	the file llvaslocal.py
	4.	the shell script llvaslocal.sh	

	2.	Cloud machine
	-------------------------------
	On the remote Ubuntu Server 18.04 based EC2 instance, create a directory llvascloud in the 		user's home directory with following files and directory::
	1.	an empty directory attendance 
	2.	the file llvascloud.py 
	3.	the file haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml


Step 2:	Setup a squid proxy server on local machine (Laptop). Also setup isc-dhcp-server DHCP 		server on the same macine (Laptop).

Step 3:	Connect one Raspberry Pi SBC (RPi 2) to ETHERNET port of proxy server (Laptop) using UTP 		cable. It will act as DHCP as well as proxy client.

Step 4:	Connect another Raspberry Pi SBC (RPi 1) and proxy server (Laptop) to Internet through same 		source (Smartphone's hotspot or any WIFI Access Point, connected to Internet) to Internet 		over WIFI.

Step 5:	On the local machine run llvaslocal.sh script.

Step 6:	Use curl to download the graph file from cloud.

	From RPi 1 -----------------> curl 
	From RPi 2 (Proxy Client)---> curl
